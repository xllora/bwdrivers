[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xllora/bwdrivers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xllora/bwdrivers) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/xllora/bwdrivers?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/xllora/bwdrivers)

THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN DEPRECATED AND WILL BE DELETE.

PLEASE USE [BadWolf Drivers](https://github.com/google/badwolf-drivers/) INSTEAD.

This repository contains [BadWolf](http://google.github.io/badwolf/) storage
driver implementations that provide persistent storage. It also provides an
updated `bw` 
[command line tool](https://github.com/google/badwolf/blob/master/docs/command_line_tool.md)
that registers all the drivers contained in this repository.

Currently available driver implementations:

* `bwbolt` stores and indexes all triples using the key value store
  [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt).

## Bulding the command line tool

Assumming you have a fully working installation of GO, you just need to get 
the required packages and build the tool. You can achieve this by typing the 
following commands:

```
$ cd /to/some/new/folder
$ export GOPATH=$PWD
$ go get golang.org/x/net/context
$ go get github.com/peterh/liner
$ go get github.com/google/badwolf/...
$ go get github.com/xllora/bwdrivers/...
```

These commands should not output anything unless something fails. You can 
check that the new `bw` tools contains the new drivers by checking the 
`--driver` help flag information. You should see drivers other than 
`VOLATILE`

```
 $ ./bin/bw -h
Usage of ./bin/bw:
  -bolt_db_path string
    	The path to the Bolt database to use.
  -bql_channel_size int
    	Internal channel size to use on BQL queries.
  -driver string
    	The storage driver to use {VOLATILE|BWBOLT}. (default "VOLATILE")
```

For more information about how to use the commands or how the flags work
please see the 
[original documentation](https://github.com/google/badwolf/blob/master/docs/command_line_tool.md). 

## Testing the command line tool

You may always want to run all the test for both repos `badwolf` and 
`bwdrivers` to make sure eveything is A-Ok. If the tests fail, you should
consider not using the build tool since it may be tainted.
